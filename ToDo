=== Next release

- Consider only supporting 5.8.3+
- Get error messages and warnings displaying the correct line in the
  code from where they were invoked.
- Write a module (Scalar::Info) to correctly grok scalar (ref) info
- Support these perl types:

    !perl/X::Y      blessed hash
    !perl/@X::Y     blessed array
    !perl/$X::Y     blessed string
    !perl/&         code
    !perl/&X::Y     blessed code
    !perl/*         glob
    !perl/*X::Y     blessed glob
    !perl/~         regexp
    !perl/~X::Y     blessed regexp
    !perl/'         reference
    !perl/'X::Y     blessed reference

    !perl/$         scalar reference (for completeness sake)
    # no types for array ref or hash ref though

    !perl/xyz:      random data structure 'xyz'
    !perl/xyz:X::Y  blessed random data structure 'xyz'

- Support UseVersion or remove it
- Rethink the VALUE construct
- Rework _emit_str heuristics
